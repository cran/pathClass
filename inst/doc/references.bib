  abstract = {MOTIVATION: One of the main goals of high-throughput gene-expression
	studies in cancer research is to identify prognostic gene signatures,
	which have the potential to predict the clinical outcome. It is common
	practice to investigate these questions using classification methods.
	However, standard methods merely rely on gene-expression data and
	assume the genes to be independent. Including pathway knowledge a
	priori into the classification process has recently been indicated
	as a promising way to increase classification accuracy as well as
	the interpretability and reproducibility of prognostic gene signatures.
	RESULTS: We propose a new method called Reweighted Recursive Feature
	Elimination. It is based on the hypothesis that a gene with a low
	fold-change should have an increased influence on the classifier
	if it is connected to differentially expressed genes. We used a modified
	version of Google's PageRank algorithm to alter the ranking criterion
	of the SVM-RFE algorithm. Evaluations of our method on an integrated
	breast cancer data set comprising 788 samples showed an improvement
	of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve as well
	as in the reproducibility and interpretability of selected genes.
	AVAILABILITY: The R code of the proposed algorithm is supplemental
	to this article. CONTACT: M.Johannes@DKFZ-Heidelberg.de; Tim.Beissbarth@ams.med.uni-goettingen.de.},

  title = {Classification of microarray data using gene networks.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {35},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarrays have become extremely useful for analysing
	genetic phenomena, but establishing a relation between microarray
	analysis results (typically a list of genes) and their biological
	significance is often difficult. Currently, the standard approach
	is to map a posteriori the results onto gene networks in order to
	elucidate the functions perturbed at the level of pathways. However,
	integrating a priori knowledge of the gene networks could help in
	the statistical analysis of gene expression data and in their biological
	interpretation. RESULTS: We propose a method to integrate a priori
	the knowledge of a gene network in the analysis of gene expression
	data. The approach is based on the spectral decomposition of gene
	expression profiles with respect to the eigenfunctions of the graph,
	resulting in an attenuation of the high-frequency components of the
	expression profiles with respect to the topology of the graph. We
	show how to derive unsupervised and supervised classification algorithms
	of expression profiles, resulting in classifiers with biological
	relevance. We illustrate the method with the analysis of a set of
	expression profiles from irradiated and non-irradiated yeast strains.
	CONCLUSION: Including a priori knowledge of a gene network for the
	analysis of gene expression data leads to good classification performance
	and improved interpretability of the results.},

  title = {Network-based support vector machine for classification of microarray
	samples.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10 Suppl 1},
  pages = {S21},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of network-based approach to identifying
	biological markers for diagnostic classification and prognostic assessment
	in the context of microarray data has been increasingly recognized.
	To our knowledge, there have been few, if any, statistical tools
	that explicitly incorporate the prior information of gene networks
	into classifier building. The main idea of this paper is to take
	full advantage of the biological observation that neighboring genes
	in a network tend to function together in biological processes and
	to embed this information into a formal statistical framework. RESULTS:
	We propose a network-based support vector machine for binary classification
	problems by constructing a penalty term from the Finfinity-norm being
	applied to pairwise gene neighbors with the hope to improve predictive
	performance and gene selection. Simulation studies in both low- and
	high-dimensional data settings as well as two real microarray applications
	indicate that the proposed method is able to identify more clinically
	relevant genes while maintaining a sparse model with either similar
	or higher prediction accuracy compared with the standard and the
	L1 penalized support vector machines. CONCLUSION: The proposed network-based
	support vector machine has the potential to be a practically useful
	classification tool for microarrays and other high-dimensional data.},
